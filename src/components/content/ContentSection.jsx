        NASA's Webb, CYGNSS, COSMIC-2, SUIOMI NPP and TERRA (EOS/AM-1) are just
        a few satellites reported that Planet Earth is not the only planet
        heating up, but all of the planets in the solar system has been rapidly
        rising in temperature. Our planetary neighbours also burning fossil
        fuel? Or the common sense that our new season of the Sun has been
        heating up since 2012. The logic that trapped heat from the exterior
        defaulting the interior to generate pressure. We are talking about
        Earth. New and aggressive trapped heat on Earth surface stimulates the
        changes within the planet.
