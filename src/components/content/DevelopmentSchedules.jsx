        Our conglomeration of NDA private sectors willingly stepping out to
        establish a public entity/company for this project which will take one
        year to build-then one year that follows to produce enough to suffice
        one million individuals. Additional one million more per year, covering
        the years to follow. These twelve emergency response HQ operational
        nests does not require our ownership. We only develop, manage and labour
        its benevolent intensions. Once built and demonstrated. These projects
        can be handed back to their funding bodies wholly and out-right for
        future emergency activations.
