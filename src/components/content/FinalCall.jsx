        We hope this proposal can persuade your sector to finance this global
        collaborative project. When a planetary destructive path tears through
        our invisible borders, we only have each other. We are a 120-strong
        response team committed to developing this proposal and providing (free
        high-tech protective <u>clothing, shelter, and rations</u>) for every
        individual in affected areas until functional governments can resume
        recovery and rebuilding.

        Our parallel engineering developments will also ensure that KEY
        individuals are integrated into Giant Scientific Luxury Bunker
        Societies. These will be essential for conducting future humanity
        recovery and a controlled societal restart.
