        The last <u>publicly recorded</u> freak incident solar storm was
        September 1st 1859 where humanity was in their infancy with electrical
        mechanics. Even then, all of their electrical components was not spared.
        There was zero recovery, but rather a complete restart of the same
        experimental science lead to today’s pinnacle level at knife-edge. Today
        our stock-markets, farming, housings, computers, bankings, hospitals,
        aeroplanes, militaries to governmental encompassing all livelihood are
        95% electrical mechanicals just to be impacted by this new Sun to
        blackout our planet. Thereafter incapable of utilising already downed
        electrical mechanical components to recover humanity back to its current
        state. This will be an apocalyptic event. But instead scientists coined
        it ‘The Carrington Event’ or ‘Corona Mass Ejection’ (CME).’
