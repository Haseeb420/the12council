        Above all current natural disasters. A rare one arises. These
        solar-storms epoch has arrived for a stretch of next 20-40 years.
        Reaching its peak within a decade. Countries never seen ‘aurora
        borealis’ are witnessing this phenomena. Hence the horrendously frequent
        earth quakes and volcanic eruptions from beneath our feet, which
        irritates the surface raising the sea levels, melting icecaps slippages
        to freak weather storms due to the Earth acting as a ‘pressure cooker’
        baking this planet from the new season of the Sun. The difference
        between solar-storms verses ‘all currently known calamities’ is that
        modern humanity can recover from them all. But not from a solar-storm
        frying all electrical circuits. Humanity revolves around electricity
        dependent technologies. We cannot live without motorised machines
        interwoven 95% into our living spaces. These super heated solar storms
        causing (Global Power-Cuts) relay mass floods occurring very frequently
        throughout our history as carbon dated by geologists stated at
        “(repeated pattern)” around “(3500-4000)” years.
