        ‘Initial Proposal’-Our planned HQ giant 3D printing factories for
        emergency distributions exercises 12 equally positioned locations around
        the equator measured for emergency distributions from ETA-(zero to two
        hours) in response time as well as housing the selected KEY individuals
        until every massive solar storm subsides. We have targeted twelve
        regions around the equator to build our response team HQ development and
        operational bases.

        (a)-Alternatively, There are extreme methods to deflect solar storms,
        which magnetic radiations can be absorbed by water. But is moving 8
        billion population under the sea agreeable?
        <br />
        <br />
        (b)-Other alternative to protect entire planet from solar storms, but
        that is conceptual only and a technology that is incapable of
        establishment until we have world peace before introduction of the
        Project Escutcheon Screen.
