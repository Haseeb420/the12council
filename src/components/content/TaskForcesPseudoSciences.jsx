        ‘Initial Proposal’—Our planned HQ giant 3D printing factories for
        emergency distribution exercises will be located at 12 equally
        positioned locations around the equator. These bases are designed for
        rapid emergency distribution, with an estimated response time of zero to
        two hours. They will also serve as housing for selected KEY individuals
        until each massive solar storm subsides. We have targeted twelve regions
        around the equator to build our response team HQ development and
        operational bases.

        (a) Alternatively, there are extreme methods to deflect solar storms.
        For instance, magnetic radiations can be absorbed by water. However,
        moving 8 billion people under the sea is not a feasible solution.

        (b) Another alternative to protect the entire planet from solar storms
        is conceptual and involves technology that is not yet feasible. This is
        known as the Project Escutcheon Screen, which cannot be established
        until there is world peace.
